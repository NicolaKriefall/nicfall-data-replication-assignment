# nicfall-data-replication-assignment
Final assignment for AN597 at BU

Files explanation:
1. an597_project_code.Rmd & .html - walkthrough of the replication assignment
2. images - folder of images that appear in the Rmd file html output
3. scallops.vcf - .vcf file created from the raw data provided by the authors, but filtered out 53 loci out of HWE
4. VanWyngaardenM_etal_PopStructure_SNPMap4b.vcf - raw data of the SNPs provided by the authors of the study I'm replicating
5. VanWyngaardenM_etal_PopStructure_GeogDist.xlsx - raw data of the distances between sites provided by the authors, used in isolation by distance analysis
6. pops.inds - 2-column file with samples in first column & population in the second column, needed for some analyses
7. ibd.csv - a file I made based on the provided supplemental data for analyzing isolation by distance
8. distance.csv - the matrix the authors provided for distance between sites in matrix form
9. fst.csv - all the loci used to calculate pairwise FST between sites
10. fst_outliers.csv - outlier loci used to calculate pairwise FST between sites
11. 6.VanWyngaarden_etal_2016.pdf - .pdf of the paper I'm replicating
